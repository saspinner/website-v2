Welcome to the first test post!

### I write a fair bit of markdown in Obsidian, so I think this should be an easy transfer. 

The styling leaves a bit to be desired, but that's just part of the process!
- more margin on the right side
- some sort of unified nav bar 
- do links work like normal? [testing](http://localhost:4321)


What about photos that I want to embed? that's a lingering question, maybe I can use R2 from cloudflare
